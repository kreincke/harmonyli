Release no 2.0 heavily uses the prework of Klaus Blum: 
he published his snippet in the lilypond snippet repository
(http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Snippet?id=967). You can find
his work - in the form we jhave downloaded it - in the 
directory xtras/blum and you in that directory with the
command 'make -f ../../Makefile lsr-snippet-967.pdf'. Hence:

Release no 2.0 has been developed by
