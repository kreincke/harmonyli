The file harmonyli.ly is distributed under the terms of the MIT license or under 
the terms of the GPLv3 license. As long as harmonyli.ly is distributed under 
both licenses, the recipient has the right to chose the license under which he
wants to use the work.

If you do not want to distribute harmonyli.ly under both licenses (because you 
for example do not want to permit your recipient to select one of the licenses), 
then you have the right to distribute only under one of the licenses:

(a) If you want to use / distribute harmonyli.ly only under the terms of the MIT 
    license erase the GPLv3 licensing statement in the file harmonyli.ly
(b) If you want to use / distribute harmonyli.ly only under the terms of the GPLv3 
    license erase the MIT licensing statement and the MIT license in the file 
    harmonyli.ly
(c) You are not allowed to erase both license / licensing statements = You do
    not have the permission, to distribute harmonyli.ly under any other license.

The only files which do not have to respect these rules are the examples of
the harmonyli.ly-package 'sn967.ly' (MIT), 'cadenca-xyz.ly' (CC-BY-SA 4.0), and
'modulation-xyz.ly' (MIT): they might use harmonyli.ly even the recipients decide
to use it under the library under the terms of the GPLv3.

Compliance Hints:
-----------------

(1) If you use/distribute harmonyli.ly (especially as part of an overarching 
work, which includes harmonyli.ly) under the terms of the GPLv3 or under 
both licenses, then you have to fulfill all conditions, required by the GPLv3:
especially those of ยง4 and ยง5 (strong copyleft effect and so on) and those of ยง6 
(Conveying Non-Source Forms)

(2.A) For using harmonyli.ly compliantly it is sufficient if the MIT license 
text is part of this file.
(2.B) For modifying harmonyli.ly compliantly or for using parts of it, it is 
sufficient to include the MIT license text is into all copies or substantial 
portions of harmonyli.ly
(2.C) Under the terms of the MIT license you may embed harmonyli.ly into 
your work and you may distribute the resulting complex as whole under any 
license you want. But that does not mean, that the embedded file 'harmonyli.ly'
or parts of it themselves are relicensed: Due to the fact, that the MIT license
text (together with the copyright statement) - in accordance to the MIT license 
- has to be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software,
such portions remain MIT licensed.

Licensing Hints:
----------------

harmonyli.ly is initially developed and licensed by Karsten Reincke, Frankfurt.

harmonyli.ly uses ideas and code of Klaus Blum's preparatory work published in 
the 'Lilypond Snippet Repository': -> http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=967

In a mail to Karsten Reincke from Nov. the 4th 2019 Klaus Blum explicitly 
approved that he 
a) distributes his code under the terms of the (American) public domain 
b) agrees to use his file as preparatory work for harmonyli.ly
c) to distribute the result under the terms of a dual-license: the user 
   shall be enabled to choose whether he wants to use it under the terms
  of the GPLv3 or the MIT

Just as Klaus Blum's preparatory work, also harmonyli.ly uses some explanations 
of Neil Puttock by which he described how to use text span engraver.

Due to these facts, you as a recipient, can be certain to have to have the
rights descibed by this licensing statement.
