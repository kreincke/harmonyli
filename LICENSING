ADDITIONAL HINT:
----------------
harmonyli-2.0 modifies and or reuses (parts of) the snippet
no 967 in the snippet database of the Lilypond Snippet Repository
(http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR). This prework does not require us
to respect any license / licensing precepts:

(1) In accordance to the LSR 'what's this' document
(http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/html/whatsthis.html) every code of
the LSR system itself is licensed under GPL, but all "content
of the database" - which can be downloaded "as a directory of
snippets" - "[...] is public domain, so you can use it, copy
it, modify and redistribute it with no obligation".

(2) The concept of 'public domain' does not exist in the European
Legal Area, but in the American Legal Area: Publishing anything
in the Public Domain means that no one claims the copyrights
and that therefore everyone may do wit this item, whatever he wants.

From (1) and (2) we derive, that we may use snippet 967 in every
way we want.
